# Maze-Traversal-Recursion-and-Backtracking-Project-1-CS114-
First project for CS114 at NJIT 

#Directions for the Project Below
Traverse a maze recursively. Your program MUST read from a file called "maze.dat".

A sample  (Links to an external site.)maze has been provided. The actual maze will be
larger. The start and end of the maze are represented with the
characters + and -, respectively. The first line of the maze file will be the number
of rows and columns, respectively.

As your program moves through the maze the current path should
also be marked with the + character. Any path leading to
a dead end should be marked with the . character.

Upon reaching the end of the maze your program should print a
message to the screen stating that the maze was solved.
If your program does not find the exit this should also be stated.
All messages, and a print out of the solution, if one is found,
should be to the screen.

Here is the actual maze  (Links to an external site.)file that will be used to test
your programs.

Only submit one file named Main.java.
